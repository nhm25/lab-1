  <h1>Hi random people. This is my first website!</h1>
  <p>(You can't do much but read. Have fun!)</p>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>My name is Naomi and I like to spend my time learning about interesting things. I also like playing games and talking to friends. I'm more of a night owl than a morning bird.</p>
  <h3>What Text Editor Do I Use?</h3>
  <p>I use Atom mainly because it looks pretty cool. That's all.</p>
